# Happy Bird

Arcade-style browser game inspired by Flappy Bird. Guide Happy Bird through an endless field of pipes, chase your high score, and enjoy a bit of comic relief via random video clips when you crash.

## Features
- Canvas-driven renderer with bespoke art style, dynamic background, and HUD overlays.
- Responsive controls: tap/click, `Space`, or `ArrowUp` to flap; `P` to pause; `R` to restart once the skip window opens.
- Progressive difficulty that ramps pipe speed with each point while keeping gaps fair.
- Persistent best-score tracking via `localStorage`.
- Polished audio experience with pooled sound effects for wing flaps, scoring, hits, and death.
- Randomized "relapse" video player that appears on game over and unlocks skip after a short delay.
- Automatic pause when the tab loses focus plus retina-friendly canvas resizing.

## Tech Stack
- HTML5 with semantic metadata and responsive layout.
- CSS3 for layout, theming, and adaptive presentation.
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES Modules) powering game logic, physics, rendering, audio, and state management.
- Canvas 2D API for animation and collision feedback.
- `<audio>` / `<video>` media elements for sound effects and game-over clips.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone or copy** this repository locally.
2. **Serve the files** with any static web server (ES modules require HTTP, not `file://`):
   ```bash
   # from the project root
   npx serve .
   # or
   python -m http.server 5173
   ```
3. **Open** the reported URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`) in a modern browser.
4. **Start playing** by tapping/clicking the canvas or pressing `Space`.

### Development Tips
- Game configuration lives in `scripts/config.js`. Tweak gravity, pipe gap, spawn cadence, or death-video list there.
- Assets:
  - Audio clips: `game-audio/`
  - Character art: `images/`
  - Game-over videos: `relapse/`
- The main entry point (`scripts/game.js`) wires together state, rendering, input handling, and the game loop. Supporting modules live under `scripts/game/`.

`-- relapse/           # Pool of MP4 clips played after a crash
```

## Controls
- `Space`, `ArrowUp`, tap, or click: flap
- `P`: toggle pause
- `R`: reset after the skip delay once game over is reached

## Configuration Highlights (`scripts/config.js`)
- `WORLD.gravity`, `WORLD.jumpV`: tune feel of the bird's flight.
- `WORLD.pipeGap`, `WORLD.pipeSpawnMsRange`: manage challenge and pacing.
- `DEATH_VIDEOS`: update the playlist of clips shown on game over.
- `DEATH_VIDEO_SKIP_DELAY_MS`: adjust how long players must watch before skipping.
- `DIFFICULTY_CAP` and `WORLD.speedRampPerScore`: govern speed scaling over time.
