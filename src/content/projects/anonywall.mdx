# The Anonymous Wall 

The Anonymous Wall (AnonyWall) is a modern, privacy-focused community app built with React and Vite. It offers an anonymous Freedom Wall for short notes, a multi-board forum for longer discussions, and admin-led moderation so conversations stay safe and constructive.

## Overview
- Anonymous posting with themed “Freedom Wall” cards and mood indicators.
- Forum with topic-specific boards, likes, comments, and reporting tools.
- Google Sign-In and guest access; pseudonymous profiles with generated avatars.
- Admin dashboard to review reports, delete or keep content, and view moderation logs.
- Responsive UI with reusable cards, modals, and stats blocks for a consistent experience.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite with React Router v7 for client-side routing (`src/App.jsx`). Global UI pieces (header, footer, back-to-top) wrap routed pages.
- **State & Context**: `AuthContext` handles Firebase auth (Google + anonymous) and profile syncing; `MessageContext` seeds sample Freedom Wall posts when Firestore is empty.
- **Pages & Routing**: Key routes include Home (landing), Browse/Freedom Wall, Forum (board grid + feeds), ForumPost (post detail), Profile, Admin Dashboard, and policy/contact pages.
- **Backend Services (Firebase)**: Firestore + Auth initialized in `src/backend/config/firebase.js`. Controllers encapsulate reads/writes:
  - `userController`: profiles, role resolution (admin via `VITE_ADMIN_EMAILS`), and username generation.
  - `postController`: CRUD for forum posts (`posts` collection), likes, board filtering, and author backfill.
  - `replyController`: nested replies (`posts/{id}/replies`), like toggles, and author updates.
  - `messageController`: Freedom Wall messages (`messages` collection).
  - `reportController`: reporting for posts/messages (`reports` collection) with status transitions.
  - `moderationController`: audit trail for admin actions (`moderation_logs` collection).
- **Data Models**: Typed model builders in `src/backend/models` (Post, Reply, Message) enforce consistent fields, timestamps, and avatar seeds.
- **UI Components**: Modals for login/reporting/submission, stats blocks, board badges, forum post modal, and dicebear-based avatars (`src/backend/api/avatar.js`).
- **Configs & Data**: `src/data/boardConfig.js` defines available boards, icons, colors, and rules; `src/utils/constants.js` centralizes hero/button copy and typing animation settings.

## Tech Stack
- React 19, React Router v7
- Vite (rolldown-vite) build tooling
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore)
- Vanilla CSS with CSS variables; FontAwesome icons
- ESLint for linting; TypeScript types available for editor support

## Usage
1) **Prerequisites**: Node.js 16+ and npm.  
2) **Install**:
```bash
npm install
```
3) **Configure environment**: create `.env` in the project root:
```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_ADMIN_EMAILS=admin1@example.com,admin2@example.com  # optional, comma-separated
```
4) **Run dev server**:
```bash
npm run dev
# app defaults to http://localhost:5173
```
5) **Quality & builds**:
```bash
npm run lint     # static analysis
npm run build    # production bundle -> dist/
npm run preview  # serve the built bundle locally
```
