# File Organizer

Desktop/CLI sorter with preview mode, collision-safe renames, and empty-folder cleanup.

---

## Project Overview
### Overview
Desktop file organizer with both CLI and Tkinter GUI. Sorts files by extension into category folders.

### Core Features
- One-click GUI (or CLI) to sort files into Images/Documents/Videos/etc.
- Preview mode (`--dry-run` or GUI Preview) to show moves before applying.
- Safe renaming on collisions (`_1`, `_2`, ...).
- Cleans up empty category folders created during a run.

### Architecture at a Glance
- `organizer.py`: core logic + CLI.
- `organizer_gui.py`: Tkinter GUI calling `organize()`.
- No external services or dependencies beyond Python stdlib.

## Tech & Build
### External Services & Data Handling
- None. Operates on local file system only. No network calls, no data sent out.

### Tech Stack
- Python 3 (tested with 3.13)
- Standard library: `argparse`, `pathlib`, `shutil`, `tkinter`, `collections`

### Local Development
- Clone repo, ensure Python 3 is installed.
- Run CLI: `py -3 organizer.py --dry-run`
- Run GUI: `py -3 organizer_gui.py`

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x on Windows. (Tkinter ships with standard Windows Python.)

### Setup & Scripts
- Install: no deps needed beyond Python.
- Build exe: `py -3 -m PyInstaller --clean --onefile --windowed --add-binary "C:\\Python313\\python313.dll;." organizer_gui.py`
- Outputs land in `dist/` (ignored by git).

### Environment Variables
- None required.

## Usage & Ops
### Usage Workflow
1) Launch GUI (`organizer_gui.py` or the exe). Pick source and target folders.
2) Click Preview to see planned moves, or Organize now to apply.
3) Review the log and per-category summary.

CLI examples:
```
py -3 organizer.py --dry-run
py -3 organizer.py --source "C:\\Path\\To\\Files" --target-root "D:\\Sorted"
```

### Accessibility & UX Notes
- Clear step labels, big action buttons, high-contrast theme.
- Log panel shows exactly what changed and counts per category.
