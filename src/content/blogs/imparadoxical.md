# I'm Paradoxical

I long for happiness, yet my mind keeps wandering to sorrow.  
I crave attention and connection, yet I isolate myself  
when I can't understand my own emotions.

There are countless things I want to share,  
but I choose silence instead.  
I love helping others with their struggles,  
yet when I'm the one in need, I can't lift myself up.

I crave love, but when it comes, I push it away.  
I love to listen, but rarely reveal what I truly feel.  
I give advice that I can never seem to follow.  
My mind says I don't care--  
but deep down, I do.  
I care more than I'll ever admit.

I dream big, but laziness keeps me anchored.  
I overthink endlessly--  
a storm of thoughts about nothing and everything.  
I have friends, yet sometimes,  
it feels like I have no one at all.

I say *"it is what it is,"*  
even when I'm drowning in regret.  
I show no emotion when they speak ill of me,  
but their words cut deeper than knives.

I see beauty in the smallest things,  
yet I'm a pessimist when facing the world.  
I'm paradoxical--  
a conflicted contradiction,  
a mind at war with its own heart.

It's hard to live this way--  
not knowing what I truly want,  
letting uncertainty make the choices I can't.  
It's like playing Russian roulette  
and letting fate pull the trigger.

It feels like being imprisoned  
by my own indecision,  
bound by choices I can't make.  
**"Whatever happens, happens"--**  
my silent motto,  
spoken by someone who wishes  
they could finally choose for themselves.
