  RAIN original manuscript
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">R</span>ain, or precipitation, is a multitude of falling drops of water formed when tiny droplets in clouds merge and grow heavy enough to fall to the ground.<br />
  Rain clouds often spread a gray darkness across the sky before the first drop appears.<br />
  Science explains rain through the water cycle: water evaporates, rises and cools, condenses into clouds, then falls back as rain.
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">A</span>n enormous number of droplets can join together to form just one raindrop, and rain is essential for both humans and animals, watering fields, filling rivers, and sustaining life.<br />
  At the same time, the rain that gently feeds the earth can, in great storms, become a devastating flood.<br />
  Among all the floods remembered in Scripture, the greatest is the Genesis Flood, reaching back thousands of years.
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">I</span>n the days of Noah, the earth was full of evil, corruption, and violence.<br />
  In that dark generation, Noah walked with God while others ignored Him.<br />
  God warned Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with violence," and He announced that judgment was coming (Genesis 6:13).<br />
  In obedience, Noah built an ark as God commanded.<br />
  People laughed and ignored the warning, but when the ark was finished, Noah and his family entered with pairs of every kind of animal.<br />
  In time, the rain began - pouring without pause for forty days and forty nights - until everything outside the ark perished.
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">N</span>oah and his family, along with all who were in the ark, finally stepped out onto a washed world when the waters receded.<br />
  Now the earth appeared fresh and clean; the skies opened, and across the clouds God painted a rainbow.<br />
  God said, "I set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between Me and the earth ... the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh" (Genesis 9:13, 15).<br />
  Now every rain ends under that same promise.<br />
  No storm is final, because a rainbow still reminds us of God's everlasting covenant - and in every personal rain of hopelessness or sorrow, there can still be a rainbow of comfort and hope.
