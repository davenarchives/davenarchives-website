<span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">P</span>rayer is humble communication of thought and speech with God.  
It is like having a conversation with Him—  
seeking guidance, strength, forgiveness, and help,  
especially in the most dangerous and difficult moments of life.

<span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">R</span>emember: prayer is meant to be constant,  
yet many of us remember God only occasionally—  
in our saddest hours, when we hold grudges,  
or when trouble finally breaks over us.  
We remember God when we need a favor,  
and when answers seem delayed, we grumble and blame Him.

<span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">A</span> wise rabbi once said,  
“You can be honest with God about your anger—just don't ignore Him.”  
We should not accuse God of evil,  
because He has promised,  
“For I know the plans I have for you”  
plans to prosper you and not to harm you (Jeremiah 29:11).  
God can handle our questions, our tears, and even our complaints.

<span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">Y</span>et do we thank Him for what we already have—  
for life, for food, for shelter, for the air we breathe?  
So often we demand and forget to be grateful.  
God also wants to hear our praise, our gratitude,  
and the small words of thanks that show we notice His goodness.

<span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">E</span>ach of us is called to make prayer a habit,  
not empty words but a cry from deep within the heart.  
We do not know when we will leave this world,  
so we need a living relationship with God now.  
Prayer does not magically erase every problem,  
but it draws us close to the One  
who can give wisdom, comfort, and strength through them.

<span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">R</span>emember what 2 Chronicles 7:14 says:  
“If My people, who are called by My Name,  
will humble themselves and pray and seek My face  
and turn from their wicked ways,  
then I will hear from heaven,  
and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.”  
God invites not half-hearted words,  
but honest, turning hearts.  
Prayer is not a ritual to impress others;  
it is real connection with a real God.  
He already knows our needs,  
but He still delights to hear our voices—  
in joy, in sorrow, in doubt, and in trust.
