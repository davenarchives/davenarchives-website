  MAN original manuscript
</p>

<p>
  What actually is man?<br />
  A question that looks simple, yet grows deeper the more we ask.
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">M</span>an is a created being made of countless living cells,<br />
  capable of growth, metabolism, response to stimuli, and reproduction.<br />
  Biology calls him Homo sapiens:<br />
  a body clothed with skin and hair,<br />
  filled with muscles, blood, and organs - lungs, stomach, heart, brain -<br />
  with a digestive tract, a reproductive system, and 206 bones joined together.<br />
  But if we stop there, we have only described a shell.<br />
  Man is also mind and spirit;<br />
  a three-dimensional being whose physical, mental, and spiritual sides<br />
  form one inseparable whole.
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">A</span>cross history, many voices have marveled at this mystery.<br />
  Thinkers looked over the restless sea and the glowing stars,<br />
  yet confessed that of all wonders, man himself is the most astonishing.<br />
  Our species writes symphonies and starts wars,<br />
  builds hospitals and prisons, heals and harms with the same hands.<br />
  Poets have called man a "noble creature,"<br />
  "infinite in faculties," "the beauty of the world,"<br />
  and yet also a "quintessence of dust."<br />
  Praise and contradiction cling to us,<br />
  as if humanity is caught between glory and frailty.
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">N</span>othing, however, defines man more clearly<br />
  than the account of his creation.<br />
  "Then the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground<br />
  and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life;<br />
  and man became a living soul" (Genesis 2:7).<br />
  Science of decomposition agrees that our bodies return<br />
  to the same elements found in the earth -<br />
  oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and more -<br />
  all drawn from the ground and given back to it when we die.<br />
  Yet Scripture adds what no microscope can see:<br />
  that man is God's masterpiece, made from dust yet crowned with His image,<br />
  owned by God, intended to reflect His character in the world.
