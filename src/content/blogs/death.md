  DEATH original manuscript
</p>

Time will come when we meet our final fate—<br />
our last breath, the end of this earthly life.<br />
Memories will fade and soon be forgotten,<br />
scattered like ashes on the wind.

<span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">D</span>eath is a phantom murderer, governed by time.  
It can strike without warning, a terrible event in any moment.  
Death ends earthly life; it is the enemy of all living,  
a powerful and invisible foe.  
It makes no exceptions and shows no favoritism—  
whether rich or poor, slave or free.  
Ready or not, death is the inevitable end  
that always seems to stalk and haunt us.

<span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">E</span>ven so, sin is the root of death.  
Through the first disobedience of humanity,  
death entered the world and spread to all.  
From generation to generation,  
our brokenness and mortality have been passed down.  
Scripture teaches that “the wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23),  
and every human life, without exception,  
moves toward this same conclusion.

<span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">A</span>s the Bible explains, death is like an unconscious sleep.  
King Solomon wrote that “the living know that they will die,  
but the dead know nothing” (Ecclesiastes 9:5).  
These truths correct the false idea  
that the dead are awake and active in this world.  
Science also shows that when the brain and body cease to function,  
consciousness and awareness come to an end.

<span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">T</span>he physical death of the body returns us to the earth.  
God said, “For dust you are, and to dust you shall return” (Genesis 3:19).  
Biology confirms that our bodies decay and decompose,  
returning their elements to the ground that once nourished us.

<span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">H</span>ow, then, can we live again—beyond death?  
The Christian answer is to believe in Jesus Christ, the Messiah and Savior.  
He committed no sin, yet faced death in our place,  
paying the penalty for our wrongdoing  
and opening the way to eternal life.  
“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,  
that whoever believes in Him should not perish  
but have everlasting life” (John 3:16).  
God promises that “the last enemy that will be destroyed is death”  
(1 Corinthians 15:26).  
“For the wages of sin is death,  
but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord”  
(Romans 6:23).  
Jesus said, “I am the resurrection and the life.  
He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live”  
(John 11:25).
