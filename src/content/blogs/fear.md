<span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">F</span>ear is the feeling of being afraid of something.  
Every one of us has our fears.  
Even mighty soldiers fear; even kings, the strongest and the bravest, feel afraid.  
The wicked fear, the well‑known great men of history fear,  
and even those considered “fearless” still face fear inside.  
No one is completely dauntless.

<span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">E</span>ach of us has many fears.  
Psychologists describe fear as a basic emotion,  
and intense, abnormal fear is called a phobia.  
Fears can be visual, emotional, intellectual, and even spiritual.  
Deep fear can cause trauma and, in extreme cases,  
may lead to anxiety disorders or breakdowns.

<span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">A</span>s we read the Word of God and walk by faith,  
God helps us face and overcome our fears.  
The Bible contains many commands and promises telling us not to be afraid.  
Isaiah 41:10 says, “Fear not, for I am with you;  
be not dismayed, for I am your God.”  
There is nothing to fear when we cling to Him,  
for He has promised to be with us and to guide us.

<span style="font-size: 1.35em; font-weight: 700; color: #f4b400;">R</span>ecent studies show that many “scary” moments  
have natural explanations.  
Have you ever felt uneasy after a thunderstorm,  
or while walking alone in the dark,  
or hiking along a windy mountain trail?  
One scientific factor is infrasound—  
very low‑frequency sound waves below about 20 hertz,  
too low for human ears to hear.  
These vibrations can still affect the body,  
causing feelings of pressure, chills, or dread.  
Some researchers suggest infrasound may help explain  
why certain places feel “haunted” or eerie.  
What seems like ghosts or strange presences  
may sometimes be our brains reacting to unseen natural forces.  
“For God has not given us a spirit of fear,  
but of power and of love and of a sound mind.”  
– 2 Timothy 1:7  
True courage is not the absence of fear,  
but trusting God in the middle of it—  
using a sound mind to understand His world,  
and a faithful heart to rest in His promises.
