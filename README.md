# My Site

A clean Astro project starter with no template content. Bring your own layouts, pages, and styling.

## Quickstart

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

- `src/pages/index.astro` — sample landing page you can replace.
- `src/assets/` — empty directory for any static assets you add later.
- `public/` — static files copied to the final build (favicon included).

Need a fresh dependency tree? Delete `node_modules/` (already removed here) and rerun `npm install`.
